# IdentityNow Chrome Extension.

*NOT developped, maintained or supported by SailPoint*

The idea of this extension is very simple :

*Provide the ability to retrieve access tokens from browser opened session*
It's basically a GUI replacement for 
1. Opening the https://{tenantURL}/ui/session URL
2. Copy the accessToken property from the JSON

It presents all the currently openened tenant in a nice list and provides the ability to copy the accessToken to the clipboard with only a click.
